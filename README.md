=====

**XHAIL** *(eXtended Hybrid Abductive Inductive Learning)* is a nonmonotonic ILP *(Inductive Logic Programming)* system that combines *deductive* (consequence-based), *abductive* (assumption-based) and *inductive* (generalisation-based) inference types within a common logical framework.

The system takes a background theory *B* and a set of examples *E* as input to return a set of hypotheses *H* that entail *E* with respect to *B* as output. The hypothesis space is constrained by a set of user-defined mode declarations and is filtered by a compression heuristic that prefers hypotheses with fewer literals.

This version of XHAIL uses fine-grained cost-based hypothesis generation. Unlike XHAIL 0.5.2, the system can run single atom examples. Moreover the system can be run by a given cost, which sets a limit to cost of the candidate rule(s) to be generated by the encoding. System is incapable of solving multi-layered examples since the encoding was not designed to represent multi-layered head and body predicates.
